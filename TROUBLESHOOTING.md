## Common (known) issues and fixes

<details><summary><ins>My microphone is not getting muted!</summary><b>
</br>
The program currently only mutes the default microphone set in the sound control panel.</br>
Double-check and make sure your microphone is set as default!</br></br>
However, if your microphone is already set as default, try running the software as admin and making sure that Windows gave Mutifier access to your microphone.
